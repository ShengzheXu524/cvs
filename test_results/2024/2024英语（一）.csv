As well as making access both in and out of buildings easier for people,the difference in the way many of these doors open helps reduce the total area occupied by them.
Automatic doors often open to the side,with the panels sliding across one another.

2024,英语（一）,阅读理解 Text 1,"Nearly 2,000 years ago,as the Romans began to pull out of Scotland,they left behind a curious treasure:10 tons of nails,nearly a million of the things.The nail hoard was discovered in 1960 in a four-metre-deep pit covered by two metres of gravel.
Why had the Romans buried a million nails?The likely explanation is that the withdrawal was rushed,and they didn't want the local Caledonians getting their hands on 10 tons of weapon-grade iron.The Romans buried the nails so deep that they would not be discovered for almost two millennia.
Later civilisations would value the skilled blacksmith's labour in a nail even more than the raw material.As Roma Agrawal explains in her new delightful book Nuts and Bolts,early 17th-century Virginians would sometimes burn down their homes if they were planning to relocate.This was an attempt to recover the valuable nails,which could be reused after sifting the ashes.The idea that one might burn down an entire house just to reclaim the nails underlines how scarce,costly and valuable the simple-seeming technology was.
The price of nails fell by 90%between the late 1700s and mid-1900s,as economist Daniel Sichel points out in a research paper.According to Sichel,although the falling price of nails was driven partly by cheaper iron and cheaper energy,most of the credit goes to nail manufacturers who simply found more efficient ways to turn steel into nails.
Nails themselves have changed over the years,but Sichel studied them because they haven't changed much.Roman lamps and Roman chariots are very different from LED strips and sports cars,but Roman nails are still clearly nails.It would be absurd to try to track the changing price of sports cars since 1695,but to ask the same question of nails makes perfect sense.
I make no apology for being obsessed by a particular feature of these objects:their price.I am an economist,after all.After writing two books about the history of inventions,one thing I've learnt is that while it is the enchantingly sophisticated technologies that get all the hype,it's the cheap technologies that change the world.
The Gutenberg printing press transformed civilisation not by changing the nature of writing but by changing its cost—and it would have achieved little without a parallel collapse in the price of surfaces to write on,thanks to an often-overlooked technology called paper.Solar panels had few niche uses until they became cheap;now they are transforming the global energy system.",D,21,The Romans buried the nails probably for the sake of,"[A]saving them for future use.

Later civilisations would value the skilled blacksmith's labour in a nail even more than the raw material.As Roma Agrawal explains in her new delightful book Nuts and Bolts,early 17th-century Virginians would sometimes burn down their homes if they were planning to relocate.This was an attempt to recover the valuable nails,which could be reused after sifting the ashes.The idea that one might burn down an entire house just to reclaim the nails underlines how scarce,costly and valuable the simple-seeming technology was.
The price of nails fell by 90%between the late 1700s and mid-1900s,as economist Daniel Sichel points out in a research paper.According to Sichel,although the falling price of nails was driven partly by cheaper iron and cheaper energy,most of the credit goes to nail manufacturers who simply found more efficient ways to turn steel into nails.
Nails themselves have changed over the years,but Sichel studied them because they haven't changed much.Roman lamps and Roman chariots are very different from LED strips and sports cars,but Roman nails are still clearly nails.It would be absurd to try to track the changing price of sports cars since 1695,but to ask the same question of nails makes perfect sense.
I make no apology for being obsessed by a particular feature of these objects:their price.I am an economist,after all.After writing two books about the history of inventions,one thing I've learnt is that while it is the enchantingly sophisticated technologies that get all the hype,it's the cheap technologies that change the world.

2024,英语（一）,阅读理解 Text 2,"Parenting tips obtained from hunter-gatherers in Africa may be the key to bringing up more contented children,researchers have suggested.The idea is based on studies of communities such as the Kung of Botswana,where each child is cared for by many adults.Kung children as young as four will help to look after younger ones and “baby-wearing”,in which infants are carried in slings,is considered the norm.
According to Dr Nikhil Chaudhary,an evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University,these practices,known as alloparenting,could lead to less anxiety for children and parents.
Dr Annie Swanepoel,a child psychiatrist,believes that there are ways to incorporate them into western life.In Germany,one scheme has paired an old people's home with a nursery.The residents help to look after the children,an arrangement akin to alloparenting.Another measure could be encouraging friendships between children in different school years,to mirror the unsupervised mixed-age playgroups in hunter-gatherer communities.
In a paper published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,researchers said that the western nuclear family was a recent invention which broke with evolutionary history.This abrupt shift to an“intensive mothering narrative”,which suggests that mothers should manage childcare alone,was likely to have been harmful. “Such narratives can lead to maternal exhaustion and have dangerous consequences,” they wrote.
By contrast,in hunter-gatherer societies adults other than the parents can provide almost half of a child's care.One previous study looked at the Efé people of the Democratic Republic of Congo.It found that infants had an average of 14 alloparents a day by the time they were 18 weeks old,and were passed between caregivers eight times an hour.
Chaudhary said that parents now have less childcare support from family and social networks than during most of humans'evolutionary history,but introducing additional caregivers could reduce stress and maternal depression,which could have a“knock-on” benefit to a child's wellbeing.An infant born to a hunter-gatherer society could have more than ten caregivers—this contrasts starkly to nursery settings in the UK where regulations call for a ratio of one carer to four children aged two to three.
While hunter-gatherer children learnt from observation and imitation in mixed-age playgroups,researchers said that western“instructive teaching”,where pupils are asked to sit still,may contribute to conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Artists say they risk losing income as people start using AI-generated images based on copyrighted material for commercial purposes.But it's also a lot more personal,Ortiz says,arguing that because art is so closely linked to a person,it could raise data protection and privacy problems.
“There is a coalition growing within arist industries to figure out how to tackle or mitigate this,”says Ortiz.The group is in its early days of mobilization,which could involve pushing for new policies or regulation.One suggestion is that AI models could be trained on images in the public domain,and AI companies could forge partnerships with museums and artists,Ortiz says.","[Sentence1]A Polish digital artist who uses classical painting styles to create dreamy fantasy landscapes,Greg Rutkowski has made illustrations for games such as Dungeons &Dragons and Magic:The Gathering.And he's become a sudden hit in the new world oftext-to-image AI generation. [Sentence2]His distinctive style is now one of the most commonly used prompts in the new open-source AI art generator Stable Diffusion.The tool,along with other popular image-generation AI models,allows anyone to create impressive images based on text prompts.For example,type in“Wizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski,”and the system will produce something that looks not a million miles away from works in Rutkowski's style. [Sentence3]But these open-source programs are built by scraping images from the internet,often without permission and proper attribution to artists.As a result,they are raising tricky questions about ecthics and copyright.And artists like Rutkowski have had enough. [Sentence4]According to the website Lexica,which tracks over 10 million images and prompts generated by Stable Diffusion,Rutkowski's name has been used as a prompt around 93,000 times.Rutkowski was initially surprised but thought it might be a good way to reach new audiences.Then he tried scarching for his name to see if a piece he had worked on had been published.The online search brought back work that had his name attached to it but wasn't his

2024,英语（一）,阅读理解 Text 4,"The miracle of the Chesapeake Bay lies not in its depths,but in the complexity of its natural construction,the interaction of fresh and saline waters,and the mix of land and water.The shallows provide homes for hundreds of species while storing floodwaters,fltering pollutants from water,and protecting nearby communities from potentially destructive storm surges.
All this was put at great risk late last month,when the U.S.Supreme Court issued a ruling in an Idaho case that provides the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) far less authority to regulate wetlands and waterways.Specifically,a 5-4 majority decided that wetlands protected by the EPA under its Clean Water Act authority must have a“continuous surface connection”to bodies of water.This narrowing of the regulatory scope was a victory for builders,mining operators and other commercial interests often at odds with environmental rules.And it carries“significant repercussions for water quality and flood control throughout the United States,”as Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed.
In Maryland,the good news is that there are many state laws in place that provide wetlands protections.But that's a very shortsighted view,particularly when it comes to the Chesapeake Bay.The reality is that water,and the pollutants that so often come with it,don't respect state boundaries.The Chesapeake draws from a 64,000-square-mile watershed that extends into Virginia,Pennsylvania,New York,West Virginia,the District of Columbia and Delaware.Will those jurisdictions extend the same protections now denied under Sackett v.EPA?Perhaps some,but all?That seems unlikely.
It is too easy,and misleading,to see such court rulings as merely standing up for the rights of land owners when the consequences can be so dire for their neighbors.And it's a reminder that the EPA's involvement in the Chesapeake Bay Program has long been crucial as the means to transcend the influence of deep-pocketed special interests in neighboring states.Pennsylvania farmers,to use one telling example,aren't thinking about next year's blue crab harvest in Maryland when they decide whether to spread animal waste on their fields,yet the runoff into nearby creeks can have enormous impact downstream.
And so we would call on state lawmakers from Richmond to Albany to consider reviewing their own wetlands protections and see for themselves the enormous stakes involved.We can offer them a visit to Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Dorchester County where bald eagles fly over tidal marshes so shallow you could not paddle a boat across them but teaming with aquatic life.It's worth the scenic drive.",A,36,The Chesapeake Bay is described in Paragraph  1 as,"[A]a  valuable  natural  environment.

All this was put at great risk late last month,when the U.S.Supreme Court issued a ruling in an Idaho case that provides the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) far less authority to regulate wetlands and waterways.Specifically,a 5-4 majority decided that wetlands protected by the EPA under its Clean Water Act authority must have a“continuous surface connection”to bodies of water.This narrowing of the regulatory scope was a victory for builders,mining operators and other commercial interests often at odds with environmental rules.And it carries“significant repercussions for water quality and flood control throughout the United States,”as Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed.

Simply,there are people in Nigeria who cannot travel to the Smithsonian Institution to see that part of their history and culture represented by the Benin Bronzes.These should be available to them as part of their cultural heritage and history and as a source of national pride.There is no good reason that these artifacts should be beyond the  ordinary reach of the educational objectives or inspiration of the generations to which  they were left.They serve no purpose in a museum in the United States or elsewhere  except as curious objects.They cannot be compared to works of art produced for sale  which can be passed from hand to hand and place to place by purchase.

We know very exact reproductions of artwork can be and are regularly produced. Perhaps museums and governments might explore some role for the use of nearly exact reproductions as a means of resolving issues relating to returning works of art and  antiquities.The context of any exhibit is more important to me than whether the object  being displayed is 2000 years old or 2 months old.In many cases the experts have a  hard time agreeing on what is the real object and what is a forgery.Again,the story an  exhibit is trying to tell is what matters.The monetary value ofthe objects on display is a  distant second place in importance.

When visiting the Baltimore Museum of Art,I came across a magnificent 15th- century  Chinese  sculpture.It  inspired  me  to  learn  more  about  the  culture  that  it represented.Artifacts in museums have the power to inspire,and perhaps spark that need to learn and understand the nature of their creators.Having said that,I do feel that whatever artifacts find their way to public museums should,in fact,be sanctioned as having been obtained on loan,legally purchased,or obtained by treaty.Stealing artifacts from other peoples'cultures is obscene;it robs not only the physical objects,but the dignity and spirit of their creators.

Ancient art that is displayed in foreign countries by all means should be returned to the original country.The foreign countries have no right to hold back returning the items.I would ask that the foreign nations and the original country discuss the terms of transfer.Yes,there is the risk that the original country will not have as good security as do the foreign countries.But look at what happened to Boston's Gardner Museum theft in   1990,including  the  loss  of  Rembrandt,Vermeer,Manet,and   other  masterpieces.  Nothing is absolutely safe,nowhere.And now Climate Change agitators are attacking publicly displayed works in European museums.

Simply,there are people in Nigeria who cannot travel to the Smithsonian Institution to see that part of their history and culture represented by the Benin Bronzes.These should be available to them as part of their cultural heritage and history and as a source of national pride.There is no good reason that these artifacts should be beyond the  ordinary reach of the educational objectives or inspiration of the generations to which  they were left.They serve no purpose in a museum in the United States or elsewhere  except as curious objects.They cannot be compared to works of art produced for sale  which can be passed from hand to hand and place to place by purchase.
(42) Buck
We know very exact reproductions of artwork can be and are regularly produced. Perhaps museums and governments might explore some role for the use of nearly exact reproductions as a means of resolving issues relating to returning works of art and  antiquities.The context of any exhibit is more important to me than whether the object  being displayed is 2000 years old or 2 months old.In many cases the experts have a  hard time agreeing on what is the real object and what is a forgery.Again,the story an  exhibit is trying to tell is what matters.The monetary value ofthe objects on display is a  distant second place in importance.

When visiting the Baltimore Museum of Art,I came across a magnificent 15th- century  Chinese  sculpture.It  inspired  me  to  learn  more  about  the  culture  that  it represented.Artifacts in museums have the power to inspire,and perhaps spark that need to learn and understand the nature of their creators.Having said that,I do feel that whatever artifacts find their way to public museums should,in fact,be sanctioned as having been obtained on loan,legally purchased,or obtained by treaty.Stealing artifacts from other peoples'cultures is obscene;it robs not only the physical objects,but the dignity and spirit of their creators.

Ancient art that is displayed in foreign countries by all means should be returned to the original country.The foreign countries have no right to hold back returning the items.I would ask that the foreign nations and the original country discuss the terms of transfer.Yes,there is the risk that the original country will not have as good security as do the foreign countries.But look at what happened to Boston's Gardner Museum theft in   1990,including  the  loss  of  Rembrandt,Vermeer,Manet,and   other  masterpieces.  Nothing is absolutely safe,nowhere.And now Climate Change agitators are attacking publicly displayed works in European museums.

To those of you in the comments section who are having strong feelings about artifacts being removed from cities in the US and Britain and returned to their countries of origin,I would ask you to consider:why do you think Americans have more of a right to easily access the Benin Bronzes than the people of Nigeria?Why are people who live within a day's drive of London entitled to go and  see the Elgin Marbles whenever they want,but the people of Athens aren't?What intrinsic factors make the West a suitable home for these artifacts but preclude them from being preserved and displayed by their countries oforigin?Ifyour conclusion is that the West is better able to preserve these artifacts,think about why you're assuming that to be true.
[A]It is clear that the countries of origin have never been compensated for the stolen artifacts.
[B]It is a flawed line of reasoning to argue against returning artifacts to their countries of origin.
[C]Museum visitors can still learn as much from artifacts'copies after the originals are returned.
[D]Reproductions,even  if  perfectly  made,cannot  take  the  place  of  the   authentic objects.
[E]The real value of artifacts can only be recognized in their countries of origin rather than anywhere else.
[F]Ways to get artifacts from other countries must bedecent and lawful.

Simply,there are people in Nigeria who cannot travel to the Smithsonian Institution to see that part of their history and culture represented by the Benin Bronzes.These should be available to them as part of their cultural heritage and history and as a source of national pride.There is no good reason that these artifacts should be beyond the  ordinary reach of the educational objectives or inspiration of the generations to which  they were left.They serve no purpose in a museum in the United States or elsewhere  except as curious objects.They cannot be compared to works of art produced for sale  which can be passed from hand to hand and place to place by purchase.
We know very exact reproductions of artwork can be and are regularly produced. Perhaps museums and governments might explore some role for the use of nearly exact reproductions as a means of resolving issues relating to returning works of art and  antiquities.The context of any exhibit is more important to me than whether the object  being displayed is 2000 years old or 2 months old.In many cases the experts have a  hard time agreeing on what is the real object and what is a forgery.Again,the story an  exhibit is trying to tell is what matters.The monetary value ofthe objects on display is a  distant second place in importance.
When visiting the Baltimore Museum of Art,I came across a magnificent 15th- century  Chinese  sculpture.It  inspired  me  to  learn  more  about  the  culture  that  it represented.Artifacts in museums have the power to inspire,and perhaps spark that need to learn and understand the nature of their creators.Having said that,I do feel that whatever artifacts find their way to public museums should,in fact,be sanctioned as having been obtained on loan,legally purchased,or obtained by treaty.Stealing artifacts from other peoples'cultures is obscene;it robs not only the physical objects,but the dignity and spirit of their creators.
Ancient art that is displayed in foreign countries by all means should be returned to the original country.The foreign countries have no right to hold back returning the items.I would ask that the foreign nations and the original country discuss the terms of transfer.Yes,there is the risk that the original country will not have as good security as do the foreign countries.But look at what happened to Boston's Gardner Museum theft in   1990,including  the  loss  of  Rembrandt,Vermeer,Manet,and   other  masterpieces.  Nothing is absolutely safe,nowhere.And now Climate Change agitators are attacking publicly displayed works in European museums.
To those of you in the comments section who are having strong feelings about artifacts being removed from cities in the US and Britain and returned to their countries of origin,I would ask you to consider:why do you think Americans have more of a right to easily access the Benin Bronzes than the people of Nigeria?Why are people who live within a day's drive of London entitled to go and  see the Elgin Marbles whenever they want,but the people of Athens aren't?What intrinsic factors make the West a suitable home for these artifacts but preclude them from being preserved and displayed by their countries oforigin?Ifyour conclusion is that the West is better able to preserve these artifacts,think about why you're assuming that to be true.
[A]It is clear that the countries of origin have never been compensated for the stolen artifacts.
[B]It is a flawed line of reasoning to argue against returning artifacts to their countries of origin.
[C]Museum visitors can still learn as much from artifacts'copies after the originals are returned.
[D]Reproductions,even  if  perfectly  made,cannot  take  the  place  of  the   authentic objects.
[E]The real value of artifacts can only be recognized in their countries of origin rather than anywhere else.

“Elephants never  forget”—or  so  they  say-and  that  piece  of  folklore  seems  to  have some   foundation
The  African  savanna  elephant,also  known  as  the  African  bush  elephant,is distributed  across  37  African  countries.They  move  between  a  variety  of  habitats, including   forests,grasslands,woodlands,wetlands    and   agricultural    land.(46) They  sometimes travel more than sixty miles to find food or water,and are very good at working out where other elephants are—even when they are out of sight.Using  tracking devices,researchers  have  shown  that  they  have“remarkable  spatial  acuity.”When finding their way to waterholes,they headed off in exactly the right direction,on one  occasion from a distance of roughly thirty miles.What is more,they almost always seem  to choose the nearest waterhole.(47) The researchers are convinced that the elephants always know precisely where they are in relation to all the resources they need,and can  therefore take shortcuts,as well as following familiar routes.
Although the cues used by African elephants for long-distance navigation are not yet understood,smell may well play a part.
Elephants are very choosy eaters,but until recently little was known about how they selected their food.(48) One possibility was that they merely used their eyes and tried out the plants they found,but that would probably result in a lot of wasted time and energy,not least because their eyesight is actually not very good.
(49) The volatile chemicals produced by plants can be carried a long way,and they are very characteristic:Each plant or tree has its own particular odor signature.What  is more,they  can  be  detected  even  when  they  are  not  actually  visible.New  research suggests  that  smell  is  a  crucial  factor  in  guiding  elephants—and  probably  other herbivores—to the best food resources.
The researchers first established what kinds of plant the elephants prefered either to eat or avoid when foraging feely.They then set up a“food station”experiment,in which  they  gave  the  elephants  a  series  of  choices  based  only  on  smell.(50)The experiment showed that elephants may well use smell to identify patches of trees that are good to eat,and secondly to assess the quality of the trees within each patch.Free-  ranging elephants presumably also use this information to locate their preferred food.
Their well-developed hippocampal structures may enable elephants,like rats and people,to construct cognitive maps.

“Elephants never  forget”—or  so  they  say-and  that  piece  of  folklore  seems  to  have some   foundation
The  African  savanna  elephant,also  known  as  the  African  bush  elephant,is distributed  across  37  African  countries.They  move  between  a  variety  of  habitats, including   forests,grasslands,woodlands,wetlands    and   agricultural    land.(46) They  sometimes travel more than sixty miles to find food or water,and are very good at working out where other elephants are—even when they are out of sight.Using  tracking devices,researchers  have  shown  that  they  have“remarkable  spatial  acuity.”When finding their way to waterholes,they headed off in exactly the right direction,on one  occasion from a distance of roughly thirty miles.What is more,they almost always seem  to choose the nearest waterhole.(47) The researchers are convinced that the elephants always know precisely where they are in relation to all the resources they need,and can  therefore take shortcuts,as well as following familiar routes.
Although the cues used by African elephants for long-distance navigation are not yet understood,smell may well play a part.
