Perhaps museums and governments might explore some role for the use of nearly exact reproductions as a means of resolving issues relating to returning works of art and  antiquities.The context of any exhibit is more important to me than whether the object  being displayed is 2000 years old or 2 months old.In many cases the experts have a  hard time agreeing on what is the real object and what is a forgery.Again,the story an  exhibit is trying to tell is what matters.The monetary value ofthe objects on display is a  distant second place in importance.",

Nothing is absolutely safe,nowhere.And now Climate Change agitators are attacking publicly displayed works in European museums.",
